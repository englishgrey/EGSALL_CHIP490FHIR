<h> FIHR Workshop Intro Blurb </h> 

My Name is English Sall and I am currently pursuing my Masters in Biomedical and Health Informatics in the CHIP program. I have a PhD in Industrial and Organizational Psychology from NCSU and have spent most of my career in the global development space.
I am the mom of two boys (4 and 7) and currently live in Pittsboro NC with my family where we have a farm with chickens and alpacas. 

Previously my career has been centered on global health and global development, Specifically in the spaces of community health, maternal health and gender justice. 

One of my recent projects in Zimbabwe was focused on how to enable digital services Ito build resilient community health systems with the hope of to combating the HIV and Aids epidemic.

I have worked a lot with the DHIS2 database and I am also interested how FHIR can improve interoperability and the use of collected data in the global health arena .
 
I am particularly interested in how FIHR can be implemented in low connectivity and informal health care settings.
